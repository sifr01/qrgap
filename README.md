# qrgap
Transfer text between devices which are air-gapped (eg. a 4096 byte key from computer to smartphone). This code can be used alongside the QRStream app, available in F-Droid. One version of the script displays the qrstream backwards so that the qrcode windows can be viewed, scanned and then closed in the correct order.
